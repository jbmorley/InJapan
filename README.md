Countdown widget for [OS X Dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(Mac_OS))

Originally written for a friend who wanted a countdown to his holiday in Japan, I have now added settings where you can change when the timer expires.

In v0.2.0, Iâ€™ve added support for different flags. The current version has the current Japanese flag, the older-style Japanese flag, the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
